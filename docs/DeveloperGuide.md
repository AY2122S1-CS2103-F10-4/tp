### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-4/tp/blob/2d1b8809aa8b78086507f8e2a5d48bc05a385e01/src/main/java/seedu/siasa/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-4/tp/blob/2d1b8809aa8b78086507f8e2a5d48bc05a385e01/src/main/java/seedu/siasa/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

-   At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
-   At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

-   [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
-   [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
-   [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
-   [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

-   defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
-   implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-4/tp/blob/2d1b8809aa8b78086507f8e2a5d48bc05a385e01/src/main/java/seedu/siasa/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-4/tp/blob/2d1b8809aa8b78086507f8e2a5d48bc05a385e01/src/main/java/seedu/siasa/MainApp.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-4/tp/blob/2d1b8809aa8b78086507f8e2a5d48bc05a385e01/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

-   executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
-   listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
-   keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
-   depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-4/tp/blob/2d1b8809aa8b78086507f8e2a5d48bc05a385e01/src/main/java/seedu/siasa/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `SiasaParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a contact).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

-   When called upon to parse a user command, the `SiasaParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `SiasaParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
-   All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-4/tp/blob/2d1b8809aa8b78086507f8e2a5d48bc05a385e01/src/main/java/seedu/siasa/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

-   stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
-   stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
-   stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
-   does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-4/tp/blob/2d1b8809aa8b78086507f8e2a5d48bc05a385e01/src/main/java/seedu/siasa/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

-   can save both SIASA data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
-   inherits from both `SiasaStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
-   depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.siasa.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Sorting and Filtering

This section explains the implementation of the Sorting and Filtering feature. They are both implemented with a similar concept.

The set of sorting commands are `sortcontact` and `sortpolicy`, while the set of filtering commands are `findcontact`, `contactpolicy` and `expiringpolicy`.

#### Design Considerations

1. The sorting/filtering method has to be generic so that we can implement multiple different sorters/fliters with significant code duplication.
2. The sorting functionality has to work alongside the preexisting filtering functionality.
3. The sorting and filtering functionality has to be *stackable*; Lists should allow filtering then sorting and vice-versa.

#### Implementation

Initially, the `ObservableList` provided by the `ModelManager` returns a `FilteredList`. The `FilteredList` took in a `Predicate` that would be applied on the list.

To implement the sorting functionality, we wrapped the `FilteredList` around a `SortedList`. The `SortedList` takes in a `Comparator` that would be applied on the list.

In the constructor of `ModelManager`, the list provided by `ObservableList`s of Contacts and Policies are first passed into the constructor of the `SortedList` then the `FilteredList`.

Due to the implementation of both `SortedList` and `FilteredList`, if the underlying content of the lists were to change, so would theirs.

The respective parsers would construct the commands with the correct `Predicate`s or `Comparator`s depending on the arguments provided by the user. Then, the commands, when executed, will apply them to the respective lists in the model.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step.

<div style="text-align: left">

**Step 1.** The user executes the command `sortpolicy titledsc`.

**Step 2.** User input is passed to the `SiasaParser` and `SiasaParser` will call `SortPolicyCommandParser#parse`, which creates a new `SortPolicyCommand` with the `SORT_POLICY_BY_TITLE_DSC` Comparator.

**Step 3.** The `SortPolicyCommand` will then be executed by calling its `execute` method.

**Step 4.** Since the `Model` is passed to `SortPolicyCommand#execute`, it is able to call a method `Model#updateFilteredPolicyList` to update the Comparator for the Policy `FilteredList`.

**Step 5.** After the Comparator is applied, the Policy List view on the UI will automatically display the list with the correct sorting order.

</div>

#### Special Notes

- `contactpolicy` applies a `PolicyIsOwnedBy` predicate that takes in a `Contact`. It will return `true` if the `owner` field of the `Policy` is equals to the `Contact` taken in.
- `expiringpolicy` applies a predicate that returns true if the `ExpiryDate` of a `Policy` is within the next month.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

-   `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
-   `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
-   `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th contact in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new contact. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the contact was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

-   **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.

    -   Pros: Easy to implement.
    -   Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

-   **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
    itself.
    -   Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the contact being deleted).
    -   Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix A: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

Our target audience is a student who,
-   is working as a financial advisor
-   has a need to quickly and easily keep track of their:

    1. contacts
    2. financial policies sold

-   prefer desktop apps over other types
-   can type fast
-   prefers typing to mouse interactions
-   is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: 

Currently, there are no good contact applications on desktop that allow student financial advisors, that do not have time to use complex contact book applications, to easily keep track of their contacts and policies.

Siasa enables student financial advisors to quickly and easily keep track of their contacts (both potential clients and existing clients) and financial plans sold to aid their operations. The different payment structures also provide better customisation for student financial advisors, allowing them to better record any policies they may have sold.

Siasa also provides valuable data and statistics in a `.txt` file for a quick summary and analysis of all the current policies, allowing such students to get the necessary information and data in a fast and efficient manner.
